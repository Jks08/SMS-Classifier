# SMS-Classifier
This SMS Classifier was made for a course I was doing through freeCodeCamp. It is a project to classify the input text/SMS as ham(genuine) or spam.
I made use of the Sequential layer from keras. The Dataset for training & testing the model is provided by freeCodeCamp.
The model has an accuracy of around 95%.
